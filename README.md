## General Information
- This is a 2 part answer
- Where first part belongs to creating a advanced regression model
- In second part we infer and make assumptions and answer questions in this part



## Assignment Part1
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
- You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- The company wants to know:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.
    - Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
